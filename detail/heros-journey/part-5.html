          <p><i>At times I can be fierce and mercurial in my treatment of myself and others. In this piece, my sixteen-year-old-self pops out of a devilish looking Roman burial urn. Working with professionals, I have uncovered an inner arrangement of selves using something called 'parts work' in psychology. A sixteen-year-old part of me reacts to fear stimulous with people pleasing behaviors or rage, while a needy 5-year-old part of myself fears abandonement more than anything.
In my young adult life, motivated by the need to protect myself and control other people, I developed the habit of sending harsh emails conveying my reactions to others. At one point I emailed a rageful message to a graduate student classmate who I felt was bullying. His response was to forward my letter to a professional listserv of people, pointing out my rudeness. At that time I felt humiliated. Years went by, and later, I learned to be more careful in my communications. I also learned how to stay present with my difficult feelings more often, which has become an entry point into more profound insight.</i></p>

            <p>The Devil Tarot card can represent the conundrum of the human condition, the darker side of ourselves that we'd rather not face. In Part 5, a fierce looking tiger is mirrored, giving the viewer a choice as to which tiger to focus on. An image of Emily Schleiner at 5 years old, lonely and scruffy, is sitting on the grass in the upper-left background, while an image of Emily Schleiner as a fierce young adult wearing a pirate hat is in the lower left foreground. On the right side, insight is represented by the tree growing at the top of the white tiger's head. </p>
