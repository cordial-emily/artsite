          <p><i>During times of reflection, when I have considered what affect, generally, I would like to have in the world, I realize that I would like to share a combination of creativity and critical thinking in the area of technology. To try to support others who face challenges that I feel I’ve wrestled with. I want to convey to people that learning (especially foundational STEAM topics [science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics] followed by a fun project like creating an interactive sculpture is an empowering process. I also want to convey to people that excellence, even in non-ideal situations is possible, even for those of us who are neurodivergent, especially if we have the right training and support.</i></p>
          <p><i>Therefore, when possible, I try to be supportive to others at while doint my web development work and to make whatever I build ADA accessible. I also aim to be supportive to the general public through volunteer service. By lifting up people who I feel are being left behind, I’m feel I’m balancing the scales of justice.
An important volunteer effort for me is the service I do at a local nonprofit called Davis Makerspace, which works closely with the public library in Davis CA. I’ve grown a lot from being a part of that community, and I hope to give back as well.</i></p>

            <p>Justice: indicates the need to right the wrongs of the world. Law and order. Restore balance.</p>
