          <p><i>In my twenties I moved to New York City intending to create an art cooperative. Some friends and I moved into a surprisingly inexpensive apartment only to find we had a neighbor who raged at his family, nearby business owners who sexually harassed, and a host would be muggers to contend with. One night I heard shots fired, and saw a crowd dispersing from my window. Later, a detective asked, then demanded that I testify in court, but I was afraid. I told them no, I would not testify. I was afraid of becoming a target of violence. The detectives said they might issue me a subpoena, requiring me to appear in court. Eventually the detectives informed me that another neighbor had stepped in to testify, and I was not needed. I moved out of my apartment when the super of my building stabbed a guest at his party.</i></p>

            <p>In Hero's Journey Part 4, Emily Schleiner focuses on a life experience called to mind by the Tower, a Tarot card that tears away solid sense of stability, indicating unexpected change and outer transformation. A gun is fired into a swirling cloud as an image of Schleiner looks on from a window in the background.</p>
