            <p><i>The joy I take in making complex projects happen at work and the triumph I feel from having gained expertise is the focus of this piece. The sense of magic in this piece has to do with not only the sense that I that appear to be magical to others because of the level of complexity involved with many tasks I perform. But I also feel a sense of magic because of my experience of desire, or will power, leading to real world excellence, followed by monetary benefits in my journey to becoming a web developer.</i></p>

            <p>In Part 9, a mystical / religious / magical figure is talking on a mobile phone in front of a laptop. This figure represents Emily Schleiner during moments of pride and joy when reflecting on a project she considers to be well done, conveying her sense understanding, integration and power around the use of the tools she feels she has become more proficient at using. The nimbus of devices arching around Emily Schleiner's figure represent her ability to customize websites for multiple devices. The green leaves sprouting from the varying screen sizes spiraling indicate growth and life.</p>
